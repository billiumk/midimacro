Keyboard macros via USB MIDI controller input

Connect a USB-MIDI controller and map your keyboard shortcuts to each knob, slider and button on your MIDI device. 

Developed for use with a Korg nano KONTROL Studio MIDI Controller but could work with other devices. 

Config.json is written to control GNU Screen and some VIM and browser tab navigation. 

Granularity is a setting to "detune" a knob or slider so that it fires less often. Setting it to 1 will make the knob sensitive (events will fire with each value change) and higher numbers make it fire less often.
