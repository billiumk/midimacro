Keyboard macros via USB MIDI controller input

Connect a USB-MIDI controller and map your keyboard shortcuts to each knob, slider and button on your MIDI device. 

Developed for use with a Korg nano KONTROL Studio MIDI Controller but could work with other devices. 

Config.json is written to control GNU Screen and some VIM and browser tab navigation.
